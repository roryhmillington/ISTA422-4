1.What is Azure Blob Service?

--Azure Blob Storage is primarily used to store and access binary large objects (Blobs) – generally known as files. It can store persistent cloud based data that is mainly used by applications hosted on Azure Cloud Services or any other cloud platform.

2.What do you have to do to create Azure Blob Service?

--Data stored in Azure Blob Storage can be accessed globally through internet and API calls. The data can either be kept hidden or available just for an app or is made public for all.

3.What are some common scenarios where ﬁle share can be used?

--When you want to share pr store data with others via the cloud
What is Locally Rendundant Storage?
--Locally redundant storage (LRS) is designed to provide at least 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability of objects over a given year by replicating your data within a storage scale unit.

4.Describe Azure Key Vault.

--Azure Key Vault is a cloud-hosted management service that allows users to encrypt keys and small secrets by using keys that are protected by hardware security modules (HSMs).

5.What is Azure Disc Encryption?

--Azure Disk Encryption for virtual machines (VMs) helps you address organizational security and compliance requirements by encrypting your VM disks (including boot and data disks) with keys and policies you control in Azure Key Vault. Disk Encryption for VMs works for Linux and Windows operating systems.

6.What is Client Size Encryption?

--Client-side encryption is the cryptographic technique of encrypting data on the sender's side, before it is transmitted to a server such as a cloud storage service. Client-side encryption features an encryption key that is not available to the service provider, making it difficult or impossible for service providers to decrypt hosted data.

7.What are some of the things you can do with AzCopy?

--AzCopy is a Windows command-line utility designed for copying data to and from Microsoft Azure Blob, File, and Table storage using simple commands with optimal performance. You can copy data from one object to another within your storage account, or between storage accounts.

8.Name three options in the settings blade?
--OMS log analytics
--Event hubs
--Azure storage

9.What did you learn from reading this chapter?
--Azure reduces the need for up-front technology purchases, and it enables developers to quickly and easily create applications running in the cloud by using their existing skills with the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment and the Microsoft .NET Framework.
